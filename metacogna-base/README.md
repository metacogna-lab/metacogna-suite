# Metacogna Base (Placeholder)

This folder will house the “base” gateway experience that links every Metacogna surface together. For now it contains a minimal Cloudflare Worker so the main `gateway-api` can bind to it. Update `src/index.ts` and `wrangler.toml` when you are ready to build the real experience.
